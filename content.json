Supported revisions include RVL-CPU-40 RVL-CPU-50 RVL-CPU-60 RVK-CPU-01 RVK-CPU-02 The FPC breaks out all analog signals generated by the AVE: YPbPr/RGBHV, composite video, and stereo line level audio. There’s also a solder jumper for the Wii’s MODE pin, so you can easily connect MODE to 3.3V to enable progressive component or VGA. AssemblyThe AVE is removed from the donor Wii with hot air. It has a thermal pad and takes quite a bit of heat to remove. Applying force to the AVE during the removal is a bad idea, as its pins are quite fragile and bend easily. The AVE is then hotaired back onto the flex board to connect the thermal pad under the IC. The AVE pins themselves must be drag soldered onto the FPC. I recommend using a tacky flux with a long active time like Chipquik SMD291 or similar. Kester 951 doesn’t really cut it for drag soldering IMO. GoldPhoenix complained about the small mask apertures, so they opened up the mask around the via solder pads. This just means you have to be a bit more careful while soldering the FPC to make sure you don’t short the exposed traces to nearby pads. I think I’ll try ordering from PCBWay next time to see if coverlay has tighter tolerances than GP’s flexible soldermask. Passives can either be harvested from the Wii motherboard, or you can use new components. I choose to buy new passives so I don’t have to bother desoldering the originals. The FPC requires: x9 0402 0.1uF x1 0402 10nF x1 0603 10uF x1 0603 4.7uF x4 0402 75Ω x1 0402 1.2kΩ. Here’s my Mouser Project with the BOM. There’s an extra 270kΩ resistor for the AVE’s POR RC circuit in the BOM, but in all of my tests, simply shorting Reset (Pin 22) to 1.8V works just fine. Reference the RVK Compendium and JacksonS’s component value measurements in Shank’s Wii Super Thread for component placement. For this first board rev you will need to short pins 22 and 23 on the AVE with solder to keep the AVE out of reset. I didn’t connect them on the PCB for testing purposes, but hypothetical future runs will have these connected internally. As the silk message on the underside of the board states, if you’re using a standalone I2S audio amp for your project and don’t need analog audio from the AVE, you can carefully trim off the top 4 pads (marked in white) on the FPC to expose the Wii’s I2S vias, and disconnect the AVE from the I2S bus. If you decide to do this, make sure you do not sever the SCL trace on the underside of the FPC, or the AVE will not be initialized properly. I recommend using a dark green Wii motherboard with unmasked vias for relocations like this, as opposed to the olive-green mobos with tented vias. I prefer the dark green boards for OMEGA trims, because the untented vias make soldering and relocations easier. Also, the dark green boards are prettier.:P The dark green mobos usually have an “FB” label near the RTC battery, and the olive-green mobos have a “CS” label.","link":"/2020/09/25/aveflex/"},{"title":"test post","text":"","link":"/2020/11/14/test_post/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[{"name":"musings","slug":"musings","link":"/categories/musings/"}]}
