Supported revisions include RVL-CPU-40 RVL-CPU-50 RVL-CPU-60 RVK-CPU-01 RVK-CPU-02 Something I’ve noticed is that there are two distinct colors of Wii motherboards. Some have dark green soldermask and untented vias, and some have olive-green mask and tented vias. I prefer to use the dark green boards for OMEGA trims, because the untented vias make soldering and relocations easier. Also, the dark green boards are prettier than the olive-green ones. The dark green mobos usually have an “FB” label near the RTC battery, and the olive-green mobos have a “CS” label.","link":"/2020/09/25/aveflex/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
